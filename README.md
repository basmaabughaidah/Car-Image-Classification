# 🚗 Car Image Classification using CNN

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of cars into different categories using deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras in Python.

## 📊 Project Goals

- Load and preprocess a car image dataset
- Build a CNN model for multi-class image classification
- Evaluate model accuracy using validation and test sets
- Visualize training performance

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
